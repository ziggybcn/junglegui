# Jungle Gui #
This project is a open source graphical interface library for its use with Monkey Mojo. It's inspired by the Microsoft Windows.Forms GUI system, but several orders of magnitude simpler. It provides an efficient events system and it is easy to integrate on Monkey games or applications.
